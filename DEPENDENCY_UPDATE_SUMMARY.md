### Important Notes

#### Breaking Changes Addressed
1. **Jest 30.x**: Updated from 29.x. Tests continue to pass with no code changes needed.
2. **@types/node 24.x**: Updated from 22.x. No compatibility issues detected.
3. **TSLint Removal**: No impact since project already uses ESLint as primary linter.
4. **CodeMirror Tooltip**: Package consolidated into view package. No imports were found in codebase.

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Type checking passes: `yarn typecheck`
- ✅ Linting passes: `yarn lint`  
- ✅ All tests pass: `yarn test` (9 test suites, 77 tests passed, 2 skipped)

#### Migration Notes for Future Reference
- **@codemirror/tooltip**: If tooltip functionality is needed in the future, import from `@codemirror/view` instead
- **TSLint**: Project now fully relies on ESLint for linting (recommended approach)

### Verification Steps Performed
1. Ran `yarn outdated` to identify available updates
2. Updated packages using `yarn upgrade --latest`
3. Manually removed deprecated packages
4. Verified TypeScript compilation works
5. Verified ESLint passes without errors
6. Ran full test suite to ensure no regressions
7. Confirmed all dependencies resolve correctly

### Recommendations for Next Update
- Monitor for TypeScript 5.9.x stable release
- Consider upgrading to newer versions of CodeMirror when needed
- Keep an eye on Jest 30.x for any potential issues in future versions
- Consider migrating from Lodash to native JavaScript alternatives for bundle size optimization

### Bundle Impact
The updates should have minimal impact on bundle size:
- Removed deprecated packages slightly reduce bundle size
- Updated packages include bug fixes and optimizations
- No new heavy dependencies were added
